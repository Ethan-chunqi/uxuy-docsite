# How to Create and Use a Wallet

To unlock Web3’s potential, you need a crypto wallet.

Similar to how browsers serve as your gateway to the internet, wallets serve as your gateway to interacting with crypto apps, also known as dapps.

Illustrating the role of traditional and digital wallets as you know them today may be helpful in understanding the nature of a crypto or Web3 wallet.

Traditional wallets are physical — you keep them in your purse or pocket and they store credit cards, cash, your driver’s license, maybe even a photo of a loved one. Digital wallets like your phone’s wallet, while intangible, also hold a variety of objects: credit card information, digital cash, concert tickets, boarding passes, and more.

Crypto wallets are a form of digital wallet designed for Web3. They help you manage permissions with whom you share your data, store cryptocurrency, NFTs, and more.

In this guide, we will take you through the necessary steps to create a crypto wallet and use it to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.

## Step 1: Choose a crypto wallet provider

There are several crypto wallet providers available in the market. Some of the popular ones include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, TronLink, and Trust Wallet. Choose a wallet based on your needs, such as the types of blockchains supported, ease of use, and security features. At UXUY, currently we support:
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [TronLink](https://www.tronlink.org/)

## Step 2: Create a crypto wallet

Once you have chosen a wallet, create a new one. You will be required to create a **Strong Password** and **Reveal Backup Phrase**. It is important to keep this password and backup phrase safe and secure, as it will be used to access and recover your wallet.

## Step 3: Fund your wallet

To start using your wallet, you will need to fund it with some cryptocurrency. You can do this by buying cryptocurrency from an exchange and transferring it to your wallet or purchase cryptocurrency on Wallet app directly using fiat.

## Step 4: Use your wallet

Once you have fund your wallet, you can use your wallet to interact with [UXUY Protocol](https://uxuy.com/en/swap). Check [UXUY Swap User Guide](products/swap/guide.md) on how to use our swap product.

## IMPORTANT
- Never share your wallet private key to anyone! You might lost all your cryptocurrency when private key leak.
- Transfer your crypto currency to trusted wallet address and interact with trusted DApps only.
