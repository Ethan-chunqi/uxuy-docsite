# AA Smart Contract Wallet

### What is an AA Smart Wallet

The `AA Smart Wallet` (Atomic-Assets Smart Contract Wallet) is a type of digital currency wallet specifically designed for interacting with smart contracts related to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) or digital assets. AA Smart Contract Wallets are typically used for managing, trading, and interacting with smart contracts to support digital assets in fields such as NFT markets, gaming, art, and more.

The UXUY AA Smart Contract Wallet is set to launch soon, aiming to provide a more secure and convenient decentralized infrastructure.
